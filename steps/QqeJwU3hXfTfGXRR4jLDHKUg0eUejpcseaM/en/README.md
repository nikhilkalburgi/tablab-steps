# Writing format to follow and copyright restrictions

* Creating a Step on tablab.io is about delivering a concise, clear, and engaging learning experience. This guide hones in on the format and writing style essential for crafting an effective Step.

## Writing Style

* Utilize bullet points and concise sentences to present complex concepts in an accessible manner. This format is key to making the content digestible and ensuring that learners can easily grasp the intended message.
  * It is mandatory to use the third person in Spanish.
* While maintaining the focus on the Step's content, it's beneficial to contextualize the information with examples where appropriate. This method helps in illustrating the practical application of theoretical knowledge, enhancing the learning experience.
* You can use these emoticons to highlight some concepts:
  * `> :older_man:`: This can be used for explain some basic concept that isn't covered in the Step.
  * `> :warning:`: The warning can be used when the reader must pay attention to an important concept.
* You can add tables when its necessary with this format:

  ```markdown
  |Column 1|Column 2|
  |:--:|:--:|
  |Content|Content|
  ```

* Visual aids should directly support the content, aiding in the explanation of concepts and making the Step more interactive and visually appealing. You can incorporate images by placing them in the `/static/images/learning` directory and referencing them in your markdown. This is the format we use to reference images:

  ```markdown
  ![image.png][1]
  ...
  [1]: /static/images/learning/image.png
  ```

* You can follow the markdown of this Step for reference.

## Copyright restrictions
