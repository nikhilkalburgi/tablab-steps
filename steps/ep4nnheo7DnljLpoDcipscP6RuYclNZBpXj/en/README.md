# What is actually a Step?

* A Step is a microlearning pill crafted to cover a specific topic thoroughly, providing learners with a comprehensive and practical learning experience in a digestible format.
* It is envisioned as a knowledge pill that delivers targeted information and knowledge, along with practical exercises. These exercises are deployed on fresh and isolated Docker instances, ensuring an optimal user experience.

## How it works?

* The duration of a Step is carefully capped at no more than 15 minutes, ensuring the learning process is efficient and fits within the time constraints of learners.
* Furthermore, a Step can function independently as part of one or multiple Labs, offering flexibility in how educational content is structured and delivered. This modularity allows for the combination and customization of Steps to meet different learning needs, enabling the creation of tailored educational pathways that align with each learner's specific goals.

## What are the benefits?

* This approach enables quick absorption and application of new knowledge without overwhelming the learner with too much information at once.
* In essence, a Step is a powerful and flexible learning tool designed to provide accessible knowledge in a practical and concise manner, ideal for continuous learning in today's digital age.
